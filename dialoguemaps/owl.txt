1
> Who are you?
Who am I? Who I am! Who are you?? You don't belong here.

2
> I'm trying to get out of this place. Can you help me?
Good luck with that. There's only one way out of this place. And it's locked shut!

3
> What's the deal with this door?
Humans always have so many questions. The door is the way. But not for you.

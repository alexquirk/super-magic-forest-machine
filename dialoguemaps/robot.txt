ROBOT DIALOGUE : DON'T HAVE THE MAP

0
>
Wow! How long was I asleep for?

1
> I’m not sure. I just got here.
Oh. In that case, welcome! I must have been asleep for a while. Time is hard to tell around here.

2
> Where am I?
Are you lost? …That’s not too surprising. A lot of lost things tend to end up here. This forest is a strange place.

3
> Who are you?
My name is Analysis Robot TK421. But you can call me ‘Alys’ for short. A long time ago I helped the humans do some work in this forest.

4
> What were the humans doing?
Oh, the same thing humans are always doing, I suppose. Industry. Building. Burning. Digging things out of the ground. Using Javascript. Arguing a lot. Humans are always so busy. I think they were here studying something, but I was asleep for a long time, and I can’t quite remember. 

5
> How do I get out of here?
I’m not sure, but if you give me a second I can scan the area for a way out.

6
> Let’s do it!
It’s so odd… this forest seems to go on forever. The lake too… But there’s some kind of anomaly to the north. A dark patch… a charged space… static. I can’t tell. You should check it out. Maybe there’s a clue there that can help me get my memory back, and help you find a way out of here.

7
> Sure, I’ll take a look.
Here, take this map. It’ll help you navigate the forest. I’m guessing there’s a reason you’re here.

8
> Can you come with me?
I’m pretty drained after conducting that analysis, to be honest. Besides, the static from the anomaly is really messing with me. I’d better stay here for now.

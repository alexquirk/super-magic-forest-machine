	> I'm not sure actually. I'm lost.
	> Headliner?

I think you ran out of battery.
2 > Oh yeah? Well, nothing wrong with a little nap before the show. Thanks for waking me up! So, are you ready?
	> Ready for what?
	> Who are you?

Ready for what?
3 > Haha, good one! ... wait, you're really telling me you don't know? Dude! Prepare to have your human mind flipping blown! Pretty soon this spot is going to become a portal to another dimension!

	> Let's do it
	> Actually, I changed my mind.

Let's do it
10 > Heck yeah, dude! So, we got the name figured out, we got the sound system, and we got the DJ (that's me), so I guess all we need to do now is get the word out. Say, you wouldn't want to help me invite some cool people, would you?
	> Sure!
	> Hey, I thought you were a famous headliner?

When does it start?
11 > Well, I'm not sure how long I was asleep, so it's hard to say. But we got the sound system, we got the DJ (that's me), so I guess all we need to do now is get the word out. Say, you wouldn't want to help me invite some cool people, would you?
	> Sure!
	> Hey, I thought you were a famous headliner?

Sure!
12 > Freaking awesome, dude! If you invite three people we'll get this party rolling. Once the music is blasting and the dance floor is shaking, word will get out, for sure!
	> Three people? No problem.
	> Where should I look for people?

Three people? No problem.
13 > Heck yeah, dude! If I were you, I'd start at the Underground Cafe. There's always some cool people hanging around there. Then I'd probably hit up the Party Owl. That dude really knows a lot. I'll be here finishing the setup and getting the tunes ready.
	> Sounds good!

15 > Good luck!

Hey, I thought you were a famous headliner?
16 > Well, yeah! And every great DJ has their crew. I gotta stay here and finish up some tunes, and if you invite three people we'll get this party rolling. Once the music is blasting and the dance floor is shaking, word will get out, for sure!
	> Three people? No problem.
	> Where should I look for people?

17 > What's up dude! Any luck with the promo?
	> Not yet!
	> I invited the turtle at the cafe.
	> I invited the owl.
	> I invited the bear.
	> I invited the bear, the owl, and turtle!

Not yet!
18 > Keep at it! You got this dude!

I invited the...
19 > Nice dude! Keep it up! The sound system is almost ready to go, and the set is sounding sick so far. Almost ready!

I invited the bear, the owl, and turtle!
20 > No way! You know what that means...? It's time to kick it off! Are you ready??
	> Let's freaking do it!







Sure, it doesn't look like much yet, but give it a few


I think you ran out of battery.
> Nothing wrong with a little nap before the show. Now, let's get this party started... where is everyone?
	> I don't know, I just got here.
	> What party?

What are you doing out here in the forest?
> We're throwing a party! Duh!
	> Who is 'we'?
	> What party?

Headliner?
> You really don't know who I am...? Well, you must not be from around here. I'm kind of a big deal.

Headliner?
> ...You mean you're really not here for the show? ...I really gotta start running more ads... Whatever! Since you're here, you want to help me promote the show?
	> Uh... not really...
	> Sure, why not.

Uh... not really...
> Fine! Whatever, your loss.

I don't know, I just got here.
> Well, we can't have a show without fans. Hey, want to help me get the word out about the show?
	> Uh... not really...
	> Sure, why not.


Sorry, I didn't come here for a concert. I'm actually lost

I'm lost. Do you know where we are?

You're really gonna pretend like you've never heard of Roboto's Woodland Wub Ravefest?
	> I can honestly say I have never heard of that.
	> Maybe it rings a bell...

> I can honestly say I have never heard of that.
Whatever! You're here now and that's all that matters.

Wow! How long was I asleep for?

1
> I’m not sure. I just got here.
Oh. In that case, welcome! I must have been asleep for a while. Time is hard to tell around here.

2
> Where am I?
Are you lost? …That’s not too surprising. A lot of lost things tend to end up here. This forest is a strange place.

3
> Who are you?
My name is Analysis Robot TK421. But you can call me ‘Alys’ for short. A long time ago I helped the humans do some work in this forest.

4
> What were the humans doing?
Oh, the same thing humans are always doing, I suppose. Industry. Building. Burning. Digging things out of the ground. Using Javascript. Humans are always so busy. I think they were here studying something, but I was asleep for a long time, and I can’t quite remember. 

5
> How do I get out of here?
I’m not sure, but if you give me a second I can scan the area for a way out.

6
> Let’s do it!
It’s so odd… this forest seems to go on forever. The lake too… But there’s some kind of anomaly to the north. A dark patch… a charged space… static. I can’t tell. You should check it out. Maybe there’s a clue there that can help me get my memory back, and help you find a way out of here.

7
> Sure, I’ll take a look.
Here, take this map. It’ll help you navigate the forest. I’m guessing there’s a reason you’re here.

8
> Can you come with me?
I’m pretty drained after conducting that analysis, to be honest. Besides, the static from the anomaly is really messing with me. I’d better stay here for now.

How’s it going? Did you find anything useful?

10
> Nothing yet!
I can still sense an anomaly to the north... it think it's worth checking out!

11
> I met a rude owl.
Oh yeah. That owl is a real jerk. Don’t pay them any mind.

12
> What’s the deal with that door?
I think the humans who brought me here built the door... but I can’t really remember.

13
> I found a strange dark cave to the north.
Really? I bet that’s the anomaly I discovered! Did you find anything in it?

14
> No, it was too dark.
Hmm… there must be a way to light it up or explore it. Maybe there’s something in the forest that can help?

15
> Do you know how to light up the cave?
No, unfortunately… the static energy coming from the cave is really messing with my system.

16
> I found a crystal in the cave!
Woah! That’s really something …do you mind if I analyze it?

17
> Go ahead!
This crystal is… how do I explain it… it’s… made of everything. And nothing. It shouldn’t exist. It’s some kind of… rounding error.

18
> Rounding error? What does that mean?
Hmm… maybe I can explain it like this. Everything exists, right? And things that don’t exist, don’t exist. There’s something, and nothing. True, or false. Everything is either a 1, or a 0. Right? 1 can be added to 0 to get 1. That’s creation by definition. And 1 can be subtracted from 1 to make 0. That’s destruction by deletion. So in the end, everything is just a 1 or a 0.

19
> What about two? Or a half?
Well, obviously, ‘2’ exists. Two apples, two inches, two seconds, two electrons. But, in another sense, you can’t REALLY add two apples together. They will always be just one apple, and another completely different apple next to it. Even at the sub-atomic level, particles can’t be superimposed or split without creating something new… I guess things get weird at the quantum level, but I’m a binary machine, and as far as I can tell, so are you.

20
> This is a bunch of nonsense.
Yeah, kind of. What I’m trying to say is that this crystal isn’t like that. Not to brag, but I’m one of the most advanced analytical machines to ever exist. But this crystal… it has elements so complex, I can’t even tell if they exist or not. Its composition doesn’t fit the ‘0 or 1’ paradigm. its structure is a paradox.

21
> What does this have to do with this crystal?
Well that’s just it… this crystal is composed of parts neither 1 nor 0. 

22
> Ok… so what does that mean for us?
It means… it means… I’m not sure what it means… but I think your way out of here is somewhere in that cave. There must be a deeper part of the cave you haven’t explored yet.

23
> Really? That’s great!
Yeah… I guess.

24
> Is everything alright?
I’m not sure… I think so. Just… be careful, ok?

25
> The cave is too dark to see around.
There has to be a way to bring a light source in there with you…

26
> I’m gonna check it out.
Good luck!

27
> It's full of strange crystals!
Crystals? Really? Do you think you could bring one back for me to analyze?

28
> Sure!
Crystal... so strange...
